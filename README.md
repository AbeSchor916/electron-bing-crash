Electron Freezing Bug

## The Issue
1. Unable to scroll down inside the webview.
2. When loading a webpage the page will be blank. The web elements will be there but it's almost like it's covered in a white overlay.

## To Reproduce

In the bing search bar, search for 'apple'. You will notice that the webview scroll bar is frozen. Click the first link to go the apple website. You should see the page is blank and doesn't load properly. I noticed it happens consistently when it's the first time visiting bing and no cookies are set. We've experienced similar issues on youtube after clicking a bunch of videos, as well as other websites.


## Installing

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
